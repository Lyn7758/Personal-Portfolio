                Hi, I am Yinan Li, and I have a wide range of interests that keep me engaged and inspired. 
                I have a deep love for sports, photography, music, and movies, and I enjoy spending my free time 
                participating in these activities.
                
                I am always looking for new ways to combine my passions and apply my creativity and skills to create 
                unique and memorable experiences. Whether I am on the field, behind the lens, or lost in 
                the music and the story, I am always fully present and enjoying the moment.

                "A Discrete Model for Bike Share Inventory" is a paper that presents a mathematical model for optimizing 
                the inventory management of bike-sharing systems. The model considers the number of bikes at different 
                locations and the demand for bikes at these locations over time. The goal of the model is to minimize the 
                total cost of moving bikes from one location to another while ensuring that there is always an adequate 
                supply of bikes at each location to meet demand. The paper provides a mathematical formulation of the 
                problem and presents numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.
